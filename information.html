            <p>Due to the squirrels keen sense of smell, they can easily forage for food at night. Their diet consists of mainly fruits, nuts, fungi, and even birds' eggs.
            Since they glide which saves a lot of time while foraging, they increase the amount of time that they are searching for food since they move around so quickly.</p>
             <br>
             <p>The southern flying squirrel is the most carnivorous of the squirrel because they also eat eggs, birds, and carrions</p>
