            <p>Flying squirrels are part of the squirrel family, and although their name says they can fly they instead glide from tree to tree in their habitats.They use their
            tails and the parchute-like membrane connected from their wrist to their ankles in order to glide.</p>

             <p>Some bred squirrels have even been domesticated enough to even be kept as pets</p>
