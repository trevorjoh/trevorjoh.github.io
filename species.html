            <p>Flying squirrels are part of the squirrel family, and although their name says they can fly they instead glide from tree to tree in their habitats.They use their
            tails and the parchute-like membrane connected from their wrist to their ankles in order to glide. Studies have shown that flying squirrels have originated around 
            18-20 million years ago.</p>

             <p>Some bred squirrels have even been domesticated enough to even be kept as pets</p>
